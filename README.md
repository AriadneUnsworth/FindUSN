This repository offers complete code to replicate and regenerate analyses and figures reported in the paper [Unsilenced inhibitory cortical ensemble gates remote memory retrieval](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.01.601454v2).

All questions may be directed to Shaoli Wang (shaoliwang@fudan.edu.cn) or He Yang (21111520061@m.fudan.edu.cn).

We utilized existing repositories in various parts of the code, including:

1. [Neuroscience Information Theory Toolbox](https://github.com/nmtimme/Neuroscience-Information-Theory-Toolbox)
2. [DeepSpike](https://github.com/mackelab/DeepSpike)

Most MATLAB codes are provided in *.mlx* format. For original code annotated in Chinese, we also offer an English version in *.m* format under the same file name.
