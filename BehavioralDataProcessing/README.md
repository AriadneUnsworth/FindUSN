# Behavioral Data Processing

Behavioral data were collected using either video recordings or a piezoelectric sensor placed under the animalâ€™s front paw.  
Raw files were first preprocessed (see the `Preprocessing` folder) and then analyzed using GraphPad for statistical comparisons.  
The provided scripts include code for customized analyses, such as those used in **Figure S1A** and **Figure S1E**.

Results are presented in the main figures and in **Figure S1**. For methodological details, please refer to *Wang et al.* (2025).
