## Synchronization Counts Calculation

The ensemble synchronization count analyses are presented in Figures 3, 4G, and 6L. The script `CoactivityMap_2d` processes specified `.xlsx` data files along with ROI location files from a given time point to compute neuronal synchronization counts, which are saved as `Line_Cell_sum`. The results generated by this script correspond to those reported in Figures 3A and 3B.  

Similarly, the `CoactivityMap_3d` script implements the same analytical framework but is adapted for data derived from 3D imaging experiments.
