# SpikeInference

The model we use is from the article [Fast amortized inference of neural activity from calcium imaging data with variational autoencoders (Speiser, Yan, Archer, Buesing, Turaga and Macke)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6991-fast-amortized-inference-of-neural-activity-from-calcium-imaging-data-with-variational-autoencoders), which can be found in the code file "train.ipynb".

We add a threshold during the test to achieve the desired result, which can be found in the code file "test.ipynb".
