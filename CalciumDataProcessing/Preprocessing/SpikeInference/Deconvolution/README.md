## Deconvolution

Deconvolution is performed using the `constrained_foopsi` module from [CaImAn]. To run the script `deconv_multi`, place the `caimans` folder within your Anaconda environment. The script reads a folder containing all `.xlsx` files processed in previous steps and outputs a MATLAB file containing the discrete spike probability distributions.
