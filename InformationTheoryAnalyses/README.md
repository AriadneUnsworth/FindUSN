## Information Theory Analyses

The information theory-based analyses presented in this paper include:

- Ensemble activity cosine similarity calculation  
- Joint entropy calculation  
- Mutual information calculation  
- Mahalanobis distance calculation and clustering analyses  
- Community analyses (performed in Gephi; code not included)  

All these analyses are implemented in the script `CalcInformationTheoryAnalyses.mlx`.  
To run the scripts, the `Neuroscience-Information-Theory-Toolbox-master` from the [Neuroscience Information Theory Toolbox](https://github.com/nmtimme/Neuroscience-Information-Theory-Toolbox) must be added to the MATLAB path.
