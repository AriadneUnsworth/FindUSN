## FindUSN

The `Find_key_node` script processes outputs from `CoactivityGraph` to identify neurons exhibiting persistently higher activity during the remote memory stage compared to pre-training. Methodological details are provided in the *STAR Methods* section of Wang et al. (2025).

The `KeyNode_CoactivityGraph` script analyzes activity from unsilenced neurons and generates corresponding network topology structures. The results of this analysis are reported in **Figure 5C**.
